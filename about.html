        <h1>History Continued</h1>
        <h2>European consolidation - Concorde</h2>
        <p>
          The weighty language of the declaration concealed the economic reality
          behind the decision. In reaching this agreement, the three nations
          were acknowledging a simple truth: that without a joint programme of
          aircraft development and production, Europe would be left trailing in
          the wake of the Americans, who dominated the industry – and, with the
          planned long-range 747 “jumbo” on the horizon, looked set to
          consolidate their supremacy. The proud European firms which had
          produced some of the world’s best passenger aircraft and pioneered
          commercial jet travel would become little more than sub-contractors to
          American manufacturers. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be at risk
          and European airlines would be dependent on the United States for new
          aircraft. Until this point Europe’s aviation industry had remained
          strongly rooted in nationality. The British had built the Comet, the
          BAC1-11 and the Trident, among others. The French had produced the
          Caravelle. Together the two countries had built the world’s first
          supersonic airliner, Concorde. But Concorde was the product of a
          political dream. It was never going to be the saviour of the European
          aircraft industry because it was highly expensive to build and operate
          and catered for relatively few people. The idea behind the short-haul
          European airbus, on the other hand, was to capitalise on the dawning
          of a boom in popular air travel. More people wanted to fly, and for
          less.

                    Throughout the 1960s, firms like France’s Sud Aviation and
                    the British Aircraft Corporation planned new aircraft with
                    the aim of catering for the growth in demand for air travel.
                    Sud Aviation’s Galion was to be a 200-seat wide-body, while
                    BAC talked of a similar-capacity BAC 2-11. Britain’s Hawker
                    Siddeley Aviation planned a twin-engine stretch version of
                    the Trident. Hawker Siddeley Aviation also carried out joint
                    studies with French firms Nord Aviation and Breguet for a
                    wide-body named the HBN 100. Yet it was becoming clear that
                    if all these aircraft were built, none of them would sell
                    enough to make it viable. They would be competing against
                    one another in the same market. Only if Europe combined the
                    considerable talents and expertise which existed in
                    individual companies and nations and put them into one
                    aircraft to compete directly against the Americans – who
                    held more than 80 per cent of the world market - could there
                    be any hope of success. Within days of the July 1967
                    meeting, a brilliant French engineer, Roger Béteille, was
                    appointed technical director of the A300 programme. Henri
                    Ziegler, president of Sud Aviation, was later named general
                    manager of what would become Airbus Industrie and a German
                    politician, Franz-Josef Strauss, was made chairman of the
                    supervisory board. These men were to become known as the
                    “fathers” of Airbus, along with a man whose skills Béteille
                    recognised at once: Felix Kracht, a young German engineer,
                    who had been working for Nord Aviation but was about to join
                    the German Airbus group as head of sales and marketing.
                    Kracht, who later described himself more as the “midwife” of
                    the Airbus manufacturing system than as a father of the
                    company, took on the role of production director: overseeing
                    and co-ordinating the job of building the A300.
