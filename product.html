            <h2>What is it?</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde is a British–French turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner. It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound, at Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruise altitude), with seating for 92 to 128 passengers.
            </p>

        </div>
        
        <div>
          <div>
            <h2>How was the Concorde developed?</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Concorde was developed by the United Kingdom and France as part of the first major cooperative aircraft design venture between two European countries. In 1962 the U.K. and France signed a treaty to share costs and risks in the aircraft’s production. The Concorde was designed by four companies: in the U.K., British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce; and in France, Aérospatiale and SNECMA (Société Nationale d’Étude et de Construction de Moteurs d’Aviation). The final product was completed in 1969.
            </p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <h2>Why was it so special?</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Being a supersonic transporter, Concorde cut the round trip from London Heathrow to New York, JFK by half. While an average airliner would take roughly 7 - 8 hrs to complete a single way trip, Concorde would only take 4. Concorde's fastest transatlantic crossing took less than 3 hrs to complete.
    
              For an average round-trip across the Atlantic, the ticket price was about $12,000, Concorde shuttled its upper-crust passengers over the Atlantic in about three hours: an airborne assemblage of wealth, power, and celebrity hurtling along at breakneck speed.

            <h2>Concorde's first flight</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Concorde made its first successful flight on March 2, 1969, with a maximum cruising speed of 2,179 km (1,354 miles) per hour, more than twice the speed of sound. It made its first transatlantic crossing in 1973. In 1976 the Concorde inaugurated the world’s first scheduled supersonic passenger service, with British Airways flights from London to Bahrain and Air France flights from Paris to Rio de Janeiro. Regular flights to Washington, D.C., and New York City were added in 1976 and 1977, respectively. 
            </p>

            <h2>How expensive was it?</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              In short, very. During its developmental stage, Concorde's cost had gone from under $400-million to $2 billion. The ballooned cost covered the following: the British and French prototypes that were undergoing a series of flight tests; a fuselage for endurance tests; 63 Rolls Royce Olympus engines; the industrial hardware for assembly line production and the first three production models of the plane.

                <li>
                  On its way to the Museum of Flight in November 2003, Concorde set a New York City-to-Seattle speed record of 3 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds. Due to the restrictions on supersonic overflights within the US the flight was granted permission by the Canadian authorities for the majority of the journey to be flown supersonically over sparsely-populated Canadian territory
